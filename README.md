## Requirements

- XAMPP latest
- MySQL / Workbench

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   - Download this repository
   - Extract the contents to `htdocs` directory in your XAMPP installation

2. **Create the Database:**
   - Create a new database in MySQL named `luna`
   - Import the provided SQL backup file (`luna_backup_2025-08-31_14-44-52.sql`) to create tables and initial data
   - Or create the database schema manually if no backup file is available

3. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - Copy `.env sample` to `.env` (remove the space in the filename)
   - The default configuration should work with standard XAMPP setup:
     ```
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_NAME=luna
     DB_USERNAME=root
     DB_PASSWORD=rootroot
     DB_PORT=3306
     ```
   - Update the database credentials if your MySQL setup differs from the defaults

4. **Configure Email Settings (Optional):**
   - Update email configuration in `.env` for low stock alert notifications via AhaSend API V2:
     ```
     AHASEND_API_KEY=your_ahasend_api_key
     AHASEND_API_URL=https://api.ahasend.com
     ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
     FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
     FROM_NAME=LUNA Inventory System
     ```
   - Email configuration is optional - the system will work without it, but low stock alerts won't be sent

5. **Run the Application:**
   - Start Apache and MySQL services in XAMPP Control Panel
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-folder-name`
   - You should see the login page
   - Use the default login credentials below to access the system

6. **Post-Installation Setup:**
   - After first login, consider changing the default admin password
   - Configure email settings if you want to receive low stock alerts
   - Test email functionality using the built-in email testing tools (Users → Test Email)

## Default Login Credentials

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`
